I am a passionate developer who want to be a port of the creation of the future.
I've never limit myself by the things that I have to do at work or at university. Always tried to adapt myself into new technologies 
by creating dummy projects to understand clearly. And also, I have a thinking like making every repetetive task as automated with tools or scripts.
Thats why sometimes my colleagues call me as script man. Last of all, I can literally define myself as Full Stack Software Developer.
